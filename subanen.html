    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The evidence of old stone tools in Zamboanga del Norte may indicate a late Neolithic
presence. Burial jars, both earthen and glazed, as well as Chinese celadons, have been
found in caves, together with shell bracelets, beads, and gold ornaments. Many of the
ceramic wares are from the Yuan and Ming periods. Evidently, there was a long
history of trade between the Subanon and the Chinese long before the latter’s contact
with Islam.</p>
    <p class="content">Despite the long history of hostile actions against them by their culturally assertive
neighbors, the Subanon have managed to preserve their tribal unity and identification,
their language and dialects, their customs and traditions, and their religious world view.
While feats of bravery are recounted in their ancient stories, the fact is that the
Subanon do not have a remarkable martial tradition. As Finley observed (1913:13),
the Subanon, in fact, lack the instincts of other warlike tribes, “and probably they
could not have withstood the aggressive control of outside forces but for the fact that
as this pressure became more and more persistent the Subanon moved farther and 
farther into the inaccessible interior [where] they found vast areas of rich, virgin soil,
wild fruits and vegetables in abundance, together with wild fowl and swine, and an
abundance of freshwater streams.”
</p>
    <p class="content">In 1912, the Subanon were officially estimated to number 47,164. By 1988, their
population had grown to about 300,000. The Zamboanga peninsula, more than 200
kilometers long, shaped like a giant crooked finger that extends westward to the Sulu
Sea, is joined to the Mindanao mainland by a narrow strip of land, the isthmus of
Tukuran, which separates the bays of Iligan and Illana. Beyond this, and to the east,
is the main region of Muslim Mindanao which is made up of Lanao del Sur, Lanao
del Norte, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, and North and South Cotabato. The
peninsula itself is divided into three provinces: Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del
Sur, and Misamis Occidental. Some communities of Subanon also live in the last
province, particularly along the mountainous provincial boundary.</p>
    <p class="content">Since the beginning of the present century, the Subanon’s contact with the outside
world broadened, to include the Visayan and the latter-day Chinese. Aside from the
influx of these settlers and traders, there has been a massive penetration of the national
government into the Subanon hinterlands for purposes of administrative control, tax
assessment and collection, and police enforcement of national law.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Economy<img src="agronomy.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The ancestors of the Subanon practiced dry agriculture, and most likely had a
knowledge of pottery making. The Subanon are mainly agriculturists who practice
three types of cultivation. Along the coastal area, wet agriculture with plow and
carabao is the method of producing their staple rice. Beyond the coasts, both wet and
dry agriculture is found. Swidden farming is the norm in the interior, particularly the
uplands. Along the coasts, coconuts are raised aside from rice. Further inland, corn
becomes an additional crop aside from the first two. Apart from the principal crops
raised—which are mountain rice and corn—the root crops camote, cassava, gabi (taro),
and ubi (yam) are also grown. These are roasted, boiled, or made into preserves and
sweets. In some places, tobacco is planted. The people supplement their income and
their food supply by fishing, hunting, and gathering of forest products. The extra rice
they can produce, plus the wax, resin, and rattan they can gather from the forest are
brought to the coastal stores and traded for cloth, blades, axes, betel boxes, ornaments,
Chinese jars, porcelain, and gongs.</p>
    <p class="content">The Subanon have maintained barter with the coastal people because of the difficulties
encountered in a subsistence type of agriculture. Even with plenty of land available in
earlier times, the backbreaking toil involved in kaingin or swidden farming, the lack of
sufficient agricultural implements, and an apparently wasteful exploitation of resources
which led to deforestation of Zamboanga forest as early as the 19th century kept the
Subanon economy at a constant level of subsistence. On top of this, the Subanon
planter had to contend with low prices for their agricultural products in the barter trade.
Finley (1913), observing Subanon agricultural methods, remarked that these were
inefficient, and “not profitable either to the government or to the hill people.”
</p>
    <p class="content">The relationship between natural phenomena and the agricultural cycle is well
established in the folk knowledge of the Sindangan Subanon. They study wind patterns,
looking out for tell-tale signs of imminent weather changes. Based on their native
methods of meteorology, the Subanon identify three distinct seasons within the
agricultural cycle: pendupi, from June to September, characterized by winds blowing
from the southwest; miyan, from December to January, a time of winds and northeast
monsoon rains; and pemeres, from March to April, the hot and dry season. The
Subanon also reckon agricultural time by the stars, notably the constellation Orion.
Among the Subanon, as it is with other Mindanao groups, the appearance of this star
group signals the time for the clearing of a new swidden. The monthly rotation of the
stars is a guide for the swidden cycle during the first months of the year (Casal 1986:36).</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Political System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Subanon society is patriarchal, with the family as the basic governmental unit. (Finley
1913:25). There is no political hierarchy on the village level, as in the datu system of 
government. The title of datu was used occasionally in the past but timuay is the
traditional title for the communal leader who is also the chief arbiter of conflict between
the families of a community or a confederation. The word “timuay” (variously spelled
timuai, timuway, timway) is a Maguindanao word which means “chief” or “leader.” It
connotes both civil and religious authority for the bearer of the title.</p>
    <p class="content">Marriage in Subanon society is through parental arrangement, which can take place even
before the parties reach the age of puberty. The contracting families go through
preliminaries for the purpose of determining the bride-price, which may be in the form
of cash or goods, or a combination of both. Negotiations are undertaken between the
two sets of parents through the mediation of a go-between who is not related to either
family. Once the bride-price is determined, a partial delivery of the articles included in 
the agreement may be made, to be completed when the actual marriage takes place.
After the marriage ceremonies have been held, and the wedding feast celebrated, the
newlyweds stay with the girl’s household. The man is required to render service to his
wife’s parents, mainly in the production of food. After a certain period of matrilocal
residence, the couple can select their own place of residence, which is usually
determined by proximity to the swidden fields.</p>
    <p class="content">Family properties which are covered by inheritance consist mainly of acquired Chinese
jars, gongs, jewelry, and, in later times, currency. The ownership of cultivated land,
the swidden field, is deemed temporary, because the Subanon family moves from place
to place, necessitated by the practice of shifting agriculture. The grains stored in bins
or jars do not last long, and therefore are not covered by inheritance.
The family as a corporate unit comes to an end through divorce, abduction of the wife,
or death of either spouse. But it can be immediately reconstituted through remarriage.
The surviving widow can be married to a brother, married or not, of the deceased
husband, or the parents of the deceased wife almost immediately marries off to the
widower one of their unmarried daughters or nieces.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Subanon cosmogony exemplifies the basic duality of mortal life and spiritual realm,
with a complex system of interrelationships between these two cosmic elements. The
physical world is inhabited by the kilawan (visible mortals), who become sick and
whose ailments are attributed to supranatural causes. In the nonmaterial realm exist the
kanagkilawan (supernaturals), who are not visible to ordinary mortals, but who can be
perceived and addressed by the balian (medium or shaman). The supernatural beings
are of four kinds: gimuud (souls), mitibug (spirits), getautelunan (demons), and diwata
(deities).</p>
    <p class="content">The active relationship between ordinary mortals and the supernaturals begins when 
an individual falls sick. The Subanon believe that an ailing person’s soul momentarily
departs from the person’s body. It is up to the balian to recall the straying soul,
reintegrate it with the ailing person so that the illness could end. Failing this, the
patient dies. The soul then becomes a spirit.</p>
    <p class="content">The balian, as in any traditional shamanistic culture, occupies a very special place in
Subanon religious and social life. The balian are believed to be capable of visiting the
skyworld to attend the great gatherings of the deities, known as bichara (assembly
or meeting). They are also acknowledged to have the power of raising the dead.
Most religious observances are held with the balian presiding. These rites and
activities include the clearing of a new plantation, the building of a house, the
hunting of the wild hog, the search for wild honey, the sharing of feathered game, the
beginning of journey by water or by land, and the harvesting of crops (Finley
1913:33). The religious ceremonies attending the celebration of the great buklog
festival, held to propitiate the diwata or to celebrate an event of communal
significance, are exclusively performed by the balian. In general, the functions of a
balian are those of a medium who directs the living person’s communication with the
spirits, of a priest who conducts sacrifices and rituals, and of a healer of the sick.</p>
<p class="content">The matibug are the closest friends of human beings, but they can be troublesome if
ritual offerings of propitiation are not made. These offerings are not expensive. A
little rice, some eggs, a piece of meat, betel quids, betel leaves, and areca nuts, given
in combinations according to the shaman’s discretion, would suffice to placate the
spirits. These offerings can be made inside the house or out in the fields, by the
riverbanks, under the trees, and elsewhere. It is believed that the supernaturals
partake only of the sengaw (essence) of the offering, and human beings are free to
consume the food and wine. The getautelunan can be dangerous; they are demons
and must be avoided. Some diwata can also inflict sickness or epidemics. However,
deities residing in the skyworld are benevolent. In some Subanon subgroups, there is
a belief in a Supreme Diwata.</p>
