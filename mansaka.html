    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Valderrama (1987:5-6) hypothesizes that the racial development of the MandayaMansaka progressed in three phases. From 3,000 to 500 BC, the Indonesians came
and intermarried with native women, begetting the Manobo. The migration of the
Malays from 300 to 200 BC and the intermarriage with the Manobo produced the
Mandaya-Mansaka. In the 13th century, the Chinese arrived and contributed further
to the racial and cultural development of the Mandaya-Mansaka.</p>
    <p class="content">The island of Mindanao had eluded Spanish rule until the second half of the 19th
century. Spain slowly expanded her control in the beginning of the 17th century. In
1851 Davao was made the Fourth Military District of Mindanao. One result of the
Spanish conquest was the substitution of the Muslims by the Christians in the coastal
commerce with the native highlanders. Although slavery, as practiced by some
Islamized groups, was effectively halted, a new form of economic exploitation by the
Spaniards was introduced (Bagani 1980:121-122).</p>
    <p class="content">Spanish reduccion was only partially successful. Many Christianized MandayaMansaka who have intermarried with the Visayan eventually returned to the
mountains and to their old way of life. This was due to the frequent Muslim raids in
the 17th and 18th centuries (Gagelonia 1967:259).</p>
    <p class="content">The Americans were more successful. The Mandaya-Mansaka were encouraged
to work in coastal plantations and adopt the lifestyle of Christianized natives. The
American effort was helped by Japanese businessmen, who developed the abaca
industry by introducing new ideas and technology into the area. During the
Commonwealth, laws liberalizing Christian migration to the area further changed the
lifestyle of many Mandaya-Mansaka (Gagelonia 1967:259-260; Bagani 1980:123).</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Economy<img src="agronomy.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The main economic activities of the Mansaka are farming, hunting, and fishing.
Farming produce include humay (rice), batad (corn), paruda (sweet potatoes), wakag
(tubers), coffee, and hemp. When it is time to plant humay or batad, the field, which
measures approximately 600 square meters, is divided into two parts. Everybody
helps in the planting: the men use the tutudaka, a 2.1-meter-long wooden pole, on
which is attached bai (a species of coconut plant) spades to till the soil; the women
sow the seeds; and the children use the wawaris (bamboo brooms) to cover the seeds
with soil. Rice planting culminates with an offering to agricultural diwata or
spirits—the tagamaring (diwata of the balete tree), dalagping, and dalagpian— to
ensure a good yield. Unlike rice and corn, which are harvested and stored, wakag and
paruda are only dug from the backyard of a Mansaka household when they are to be
consumed. Cash crops include coffee and hemp which command a good price in the
lowlands (Magaña 1973:21).</p>
    <p class="content">The Mansaka have developed various ingenious methods of fishing: the yamangot
or the use of naturally hooked rattan shoots to catch mudfish; the gabukad or the
debris-cleaning method to make fish surface; the longyab or the hole-digging method to
trap fish; the ligwat or the use of arawas placed under rocks to trap fish; the yaaraw
or the setting of a bamboo fence across a stream to make a catch; the yobas or the
stream-draining method to catch fish; the tuba or the use of the poisonous vine lagtang
(Anaminta cocculus) to make a catch; the bingwit (angling); and the saranaw, another
mudfish-catching method. Bows and arrows are also used in fishing. The arrow used
for fishing is different from the one used in hunting, the former being a 1-meter
bagakay stick on which is attached two steel prongs (Magaña 1973:22).</p>
    <p class="content">The main Mansaka hunting weapons are the tuklo (spear) and the sumpitan (blowgun),
a 1.8-meter hollow bagakay pole used in hunting fowl. Traps are also very popular
among the Mansaka. The more common ones include the purot or stick coated with
paste from the tegep tree; the utotan or whistle which simulates the sound of the
limokon (edible dovelike bird believed to carry omens), and is used together with
the purot; the litag or trap consisting of bai pegs, chicken decoy, and movable rattan
rings by which chickens are entangled; the katal or trapper’s basket which is used to
contain the catch; and the arejas or arched rattan twine, 15 centimeters high, which
uses fruits as bait. (Magaña 1973:22-23)</p>
    <p class="content">The Mansaka farm, fish, and hunt mainly for subsistence. From their harvest,
many dishes can be made. From the wakag, paruda, humay, batad, iahas (pork), usa
(venison), manok (chicken), katumbal (pepper), and isda (fish), 19 “dishes” can be
made: the liorot or pork cooked in fresh tamboorang (bamboo tube) which had been
lined with siapotan or kalapi leaves; the liogoan or minced meat cooked in fresh
tamboorang; the siapotanan or kalapi-wrapped fish cooked in tamboorang; the yobol
or washed rice cooked in tamboorang; the lioon (boiled rice); the bianigan or rice
cooked in clay pot which had been lined with leaves; the tamo or cereal prepared from 
rice boiled in a rectangular balico basket; the kiabidak or humay, wakag shoots, and
katumbal cooked together; the kiaradoy or boiled wakag shoots and roots seasoned
with pepper; the yapay or boiled wakag shoots; the miaratok or iahas and manok
cooked together; the liaga or boiled iahas or manok; the tiora, the Mansaka soup; the
bibog or native gruel; the biaki or boiled paruda shreds wrapped in banana leaf; the
kiodkodan or boiled shrimps with corn wrapped in agikik leaves; the piasagan or
boiled fish or meat; the ginipsaw or boiled minced meat in a specially designed bark
container; and the lioroban or minced meat cooked in a pot (Magaña 1973:19-20).</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Political System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Like the Mandaya, the Mansaka have unwritten laws based on their traditions,
i.e., laws which emanate from their customs and beliefs, which have guided the
political leaders in judicial, social, and political matters. Traditional leadership
revolves around the following: the matadong or old wise man who has great influence
in community decision making; the bagani or maniklad, a member of the warrior class
who used to lead the community with help and advice from the matadong; the balian
(shaman) who is usually a female medicine person who officiates in rituals involving
sickness, death, and harvest. In the 1920s, as the traditional settlements were
transformed into barrios, the Americans abolished the bagani or maniklad class and
replaced it with the office of the barrio lieutenant or tenyente (Fuentes and De la Cruz
1980:8; Magaña 1973:30; Bagani 1980:23).</p>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Social Organization and Customs<img src="network.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Social organization among the Mansaka depends on kinship ties which regulate the
interrelationship between families and between members of a family. Kinship ties are
indicated in the Mansaka vocabulary: ama (father), ina (mother), anak (child), anakun
(niece or nephew), arayon (parent’s relatives), asawa (wife), babo (aunt), bana
(husband), bapa (uncle), baraqi (child’s spouse’s siblings and parents), bayaw (a male
brother-in-law), bilas (spouse’s sibling-in-law), ginikanan (parents and grandparents),
igagaw (cousin), indas (husband’s sister-in-law), ipag (sister-in-law or brother-in-law),
kimod (last child), lomon (younger brother, sister, or cousin), mataranak (family),
ogangan (parents-in-law), ompo (grandparent, grandchild), ompo tood (great
grandparent), ompo taringa (great great grandparent), panganay (first-born child),
taganak (parents, aunts, uncles), tamisa (only child), and tud tud lomon (brother or
sister of the same father and mother) (Elkins 1984:174-175).</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Mansaka manaog or domestic gods are represented by wooden statues standing
on a parangka (pedestal). Manaog have sexes which can be discerned on the sculpture
and ornaments on the statues. Offerings are given to the manaog after rice planting,
harvest, and before death. The rituals can be either indoor or outdoor. If indoor, the
balian places humay, wine, manok, lime, tobacco, and betel nut on a siklat (a square
bamboo platform suspended from the ceiling). If outdoor, the balian constructs a siklat
with the use of four 1-meter wooden poles arranged like an Indian teepee skeleton.
Either way, a manaog about 30 centimeters high, is placed at the foot of the siklat.
The manaog of the balian are kept on the ceiling near the kitchen, where they become
black from the smoke.</p>
    <p class="content">Christianity has been introduced and accepted by many Mansaka, but it has not
totally eradicated the manaog cult. The Mansaka believe in the saving grace of the
Christian God but remnants of the old religion, as in many ethnic groups, persist.
Curiously the Mansaka belong to various Christian denominations, often at the same
time. For example, in 1973, close to 95 percent of the Mansaka were Catholics at the
same time that they were members of other Christian sects—the Baptist Church, the
Jehovah’s Witnesses, and so forth (Magaña 1973:15, 26-27).</p>
    <p class="content">Old Mansaka religious beliefs persist in native medicine. For wounds, the Mansaka
mix crushed marabiga roots, chewed sakati sprouts, pamantigi leaves, and oiled lenek;
for headaches and stomach troubles, heated kepet leaves, roasted baganga fruit, boiled
aribetbet roots, boiled buds, and sterilized sara saps; for boils, crushed darupang
flowers and scraped pitugu fruit; for pinkish eyes, scraped tambabasi stalks; for
constipation, ground warasiman and boiled anuring; for malaria, the bark of the bagol
tree; for fractures, the bark of the arit tree; and for a Mansaka mother’s first bath after
giving birth, agosais, basikay, gapas, and baay (Magaña 1973:27).</p>
<p class="content">Nowadays, traditional medicine is rarely used even by the children of the balian,
who go to the Christian town doctor. But the older Mansaka still believe that sickness
is caused by supernatural beings and thus make offerings to the gods
(Magaña 1973:28).</p>
