    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Higaonon  Indigenous  People  is  the  second  largest  cultural  community  in  Agusan  del  Sur.  The concentration  of  this  tribe’s  populace  is  situated  at  Esperanza  in  Agusan  del  Sur,  Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon and Agusan del Norte. Higaonon is derived from the native word "gaon" which means from coast to mountain, literally, they are mountain people. Also, the Higaonon are somewhat nomadic,  i.e.  they travel from  one  mountain to  another,  looking for  more fertile  soil and better harvest.</p>
    <p class="content">It is believed  that  the earliest settler  at  Misamis Oriental had a  dream of  a  bull with  a precious stone called Lakdag in his mouth. If he would to go to the place revealed to him in the vision and courageously  remove  the  Lakdag  from  the  mouth  of  the  bull,  then  they  will  be  raptured  to heaven. Unfortunately the settlers went to that place saw the bull but were afraid to kill the bull and remove the Lakdag so they could not be recaptured and had to settle there in Sinakungan.</p>
    <p class="content">In addition, the Higaonon people are  of medium built  with  average height of about 5 feet and 2 inches  and  of  lighter skin  complexion  compared with  the other  tribes  in  the  province. Quiet  a number  of  them  have a  very recognizable  European  features, aquiline  nose, deep-set  eyes  and prominent  cheeks,  a  legacy  of  the  intermarriage  between  the  natives  and  the  Spanish conquiestadores. Generally, they are warm and friendly and volatile when intimidated. However, they are  one  of  the  best organized  and closely knitted  as  well. Furthermore,  the Higaonon  are good hunters and farmers.</p>
    <p class="content">The Spanish established their first settlement in the area in year 1521 AD.  In order to attract the natives  to move  to  the settlement  and  adopt  Christianity, the  Spanish  government  through the famous  priest,  Reverend  Father  Saturnino  Urios,  a  Jesuit  Order, built  a  church.  Therefore,  the church became not only the temple of worship but also the meeting place of the people to discuss various matters  such as religion,  taxation, voluntary labor  and loyalty  to  the King  of  Spain.   It was during this time that Esperanza got its name.</p>
    <p class="content">Even  before  the  arrival of  the  Spaniards  the  natives had  their own  system  of government.    A certain Datu named Ligcuban, a brave and daring man who defied Christianity and refused to be baptized, ruled them. He told the emissary of Father Urios  to  bring  him first the head of Father Urios before he will submit to baptism. Datu Ligcuban and his men made several attacks on the soldiers  patrolling  the  town.  On  the  other  hand,  Father  Urios exerted  effort  to convince  Datu Ligcuban to embrace Christian  religion, but  failed. He  then  hired another  Datu name  Sag-ud to secretly kill Datu Ligcuban and bring his head to Butuan at once; on board a government owned boat named Pacita. Datu Sag-ud succeeded in killing Datu Ligcuban. Later the boat was named Ligcuban  as a  reminder  of Datu  Ligcubans  defiance  to  Christianity  and  as a  warning  to other Datus.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Higaonons believed in supernatural beings that dwelt in mountains, forests, trees, or simply existed in some portion of the universe. They also believed in the existence of beneficent spirits like those of their dead datus as well as in malevolent ones, and in the creator of all things—the God Magbabaya. Rituals and ceremonies have remained a part of the Higaonon way of life until the present. The tribal community held a Kaamulan Festival any time during the year either to give thanks for a good harvest, to celebrate a victory, a wedding, a baptism, or a family reunion. </p>
    <p class="content">In the pamalas rite, the palms of the bride and the bridegroom were smeared with chicken blood to sanctify their vows. The panawagtawag consisted of oath-taking by the couple and the pangapongon, the prayers intoned by the datus invoking the ancestral spirits’ blessing on the couple. It also includes the sense of feelings as indicated in the focus group discussion, like loving the partner, being religious to God, and remaining faithful to the partner. Love must be existing between husband and wife to establish a harmonious relationship within the family. The key informant used the omniscient point of view as he has sufficient knowledge on how Higaonons chose a partner for marriage before because he experienced the same custom as passed on to him by his parents.</p>

    <p class="content">The value of aesthetics and creativity are evident in this essay. Like most people, Higaonons experience the need to express their feelings and ideas through an artistic medium. They revealed these feelings and experiences in their songs, prayers, verbal jousts,and folklore that mirrored the beliefs and concerns of their society.</p>
    <p class="content">The Higaonon informants identified the Kaamulan Festival as the only means of preserving their culture. The Kaamulan Festival is a kind of celebration anytime during the year which aims to give thanks for a good harvest, to celebrate a victory, a wedding, a baptism, or a family reunion. The members of the tribe and those of the neighboring local groups come together for the celebration. They showed their customs and traditions, such as folk songs, oratory, poems, dances, and customs that are almost forgotten today. It also involves an authentic showing-off of their weapons, clothing, dressing, and weaving. It also shows the agricultural aspects of farming (planting and harvesting) which is accompanied by the beating of percussive musical instruments. “We believed that harvest becomes abundant if planting is accompanied with the singing and beating of gongs and other percussive instruments,” stressed by an informant who is a datu. </p>
    <p class="content">These are the practices of the Higaonons as to the preservation of their literature. They wished that their stories be written in books so that these can be remembered and learned by the next generations. The emergence of diverse culture in Esperanza, Agusandel Sur is a threat to the banishing Higaonon cultural heritage. It is the fear of the old Higaonons that sometime in the future their descendants might no longer cherish their culture and might lose their identity.</p>
