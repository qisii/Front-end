    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The earliest Maranao historical records, found in the salsila or oral traditions are
about the Kingdom of Bumbaran from where came the ancestors of the present-day
Maranao. Legend says that when the first Muslim missionaries came to preach Islam,
the inhabitants of Bumbaran refused to be converted. The entire kingdom then sank
into what is now Lake Lanao. Only four people survived and they became the
ancestors of today’s Maranao.</p>
    <p class="content">Before Islam, the Maranao were organized into independent and kinship-based
political units. These units settled in various parts of the lake, but were organized into
four pengampong (states or encampments) administered by local datu (chieftains);
these states were Bayabao, Masiu, Unayan, and Balo-i (Darangen 1980:37).</p>
    <p class="content">In the early 16th century, Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan, an Arab-Malay
preacher from the royal house of Malacca, arrived in what is now Malabang,
introduced the Islamic faith and customs, settled down with a local princess, and
founded a new political order. Indigenous administrative structures persisted under
the newly introduced sultanate system. Islam became the catalyst for Maranao
political integration, the process of which was frustrated by the rise of the
Maguindanao royalty. Maranao leadership had been politically affiliated with the
Maguindanao until after the decline of the latter’s power (Che Man 1990:21;
Darangen 1980:37-38).</p>
    <p class="content">With the arrival of the Spaniards came successive expeditions to conquer the 
Muslim groups in the South. Called the “Moro Wars,” these battles were waged
intermittently from 1578 between the Spanish colonial government and the Muslims
of Mindanao. In 1578, a Spanish expedition that had been sent against Brunei
defeated the Tausug of Sulu. A peace treaty was forged. The victory did not establish
Spanish sovereignty over Sulu, as the Tausug abrogated the treaty as soon as the
Spaniards had left. In 1579 an expedition sent by Governor Francisco de Sande failed
to conquer Maguindanao. In 1596, the Spanish government gave Captain Rodriguez
de Figueroa the sole right to colonize Mindanao. He was killed in an ambush, and his
troops retreated to an anchorage near Zamboanga. In retaliation, the Muslims raided
Visayan towns in Panay, Negros, and Cebu. These were repulsed by Spanish and
Visayan forces (Angeles 1974:27-28; Saber 1976:13).</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Economy<img src="agronomy.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Lake Lanao is the single most important source of livelihood for the Maranao. It
provides the major source of protein diet for the Maranao, and supplies their water
and energy needs. Economically important species of fish in Lake Lanao include the
aruan (mudfish), katipa (catfish), popoyo (climbing perch), kasili (eel), bongkaong
(carp), mampawi (tilapia), gorami (plasalit), tamban (black bass), kadurong (goby),
and bangos (milkfish). From 1963 to 1964, fish production from Lake Lanao was
only 1,986,330, kilograms for the entire lake, while fish consumption of the entire
population of Lanao del Sur was 8,132,156.22) kilograms (Villaluz 1975:6-7).</p>
    <p class="content">Cheap electric power is provided by the Maria Cristina Falls, the source of which is
Lake Lanao, 30 kilometers away. Trade is conducted through the lake, thus avoiding
expensive land transport problems (Plagata and Aquino 1976:71).</p>
    <p class="content">Around Lake Lanao are forest resources which have been tapped for commercial
purposes. During the fiscal year 1973-74, timber harvest around the lake amounted
to over 69.5 million board feet for export and domestic markets, with a value of 
approximately 65.6 million pesos. (Fernandez 1975:9).</p>
    <p class="content">Rice is the main agricultural product of Maranao farms, which average 1-2 hectares.
Harvest is once a year. Other produce include corn, fruits such as bananas, jackftuits,
madang, durian, avocado, mangoes, and vegetables such as cabbage, Chinese leaf,
onions, carrots, cassava, sweet potato, and potato. The Maranao do not generally
engage in commercial agriculture. The carabao is used for work and food. Other
animals raised are the goat and, to a much less extent, chicken (Plagata et al.
1976:71-72).</p>
    <p class="content">Tradition has handed down the Maranao property law, which is very complex.
Land ownership is difficult to assess as property transfer is often contested by
traditional claims. Infrastructure for even the most basic services—like water—
remains inadequate. Transportation and communication facilities are still wanting,
and so are financial and manufacturing establishments. With basically a subsistence
economy, the Maranao standard of living has not improved substantially. However,
formal education is slowly changing the economic structure, and introducing a new
class of professionals (Plagata et al. 1976:72-75).</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Political System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Maranao live in agama or hamlets, politically defined by the presence of at
least one torogan or great house, where community gatherings are held. Every agama
is organized into two or more bangsa or ambilineal descent lines, each of which owns
at least one hereditary title. The actual holder of the major title is considered the
representative of the bangsa. Within each agama, one or more title holders belong to a
superior political level and are given the title sultan. This larger organization of
hamlets is the effective political community, and its strong federal system serves to
unite the four Maranao pengampong (states or encampments)—Bayabao, Masiu,
Unayan, and Baloi—into the pat-a-pengampong ko ranao under the taritib or ancient
order of customs, traditions, and usages observed in the community.</p>
    <p class="content">In the past, Maranao society was defined by a three-rank system which
included persons having claim to titles, free people with no claim to titles, and bond
slaves. Nowadays, with slavery abolished, stratification depends more on wealth and
power, and is expressed in the bangsa system. Che Man (1990:116-124) categorizes
Muslim leadership into three elite groups: traditional, secular, and religious.</p>
    <p class="content">The sultan, datu, and other aristocrats who constitute the traditional elite continue
to wield influence in Maranao society. Although stripped of temporal power, they are 
nevertheless seen as symbolizing Islam and adat. The highly educated professionals
such as academicians, lawyers, doctors, and engineers, belong to the secular elite.
Because of their education, they are able to exercise considerable influence in Maranao
society. The religious elite consists of the imam, kali (religious judge), religious
teachers, preachers, and pious men. Combinations are possible: an educated person of
noble descent who is also a religious teacher belongs to the three elite groups. Most
holders of government positions (regional, provincial, and municipal) belong to one or
a combination of these elite groups.</p>
    <p class="content">Mednick (1975) claims that the national system has had varied effects on the
traditional political structure. At the local level, the role of the mayor is given to those
who can deliver votes for the dominant political party, maintain peace and order, and
advise provincial and national authorities on municipal matters. The traditional sultan
or datu often assumes this role, and in effect becomes the most powerful sultan in the
area.</p>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Social Organization and Customs<img src="network.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Maranao social structure can be characterized not so much in terms of exclusive
ranks associated with exclusive obligations and privileges, but in terms of the rights
and duties accorded to “lines of descent.” Each agama, and hence each descent line, is
ranked as either pegawiden (literally, “the carried”) or pegawid (literally “the carrier”).
Therefore a person’s inherited rights, i.e., claims on land, title, and ceremonial
payments, depend on descent lines; these privileges only apply in the agama where
these rights originate. It is possible for a prestigious person of one agama to have only
the privileges and obligations of a slave in another. His personal prestige may be
affected in such a case, but his claims and his capacity to give these to his children
cannot be touched (Warriner 1975:40-41).</p>
    <p class="content">Before childbirth, the panday checks the abdomen to determine if the child is in
the correct position and is moving normally; the mother lies on the lantay (delivery
bed), her legs covered with malong (a tubular skirt worn by both sexes). During
delivery, the panday’s hands work through and within the malong. If the delivery is
delayed, the wife is made to drink a ginger mixture. After delivery, the umbilical cord
is tied to the nearest base and cut with an irab (a bamboo slit). Ashes are applied to
the cut portion to stop the bleeding.</p>
    <p class="content">Baptismal rites consist of an imam holding the baby while calling the azan
(Muslim call to prayer), which symbolizes the child’s purpose in life—to worship
God. In crossing Lake Lanao for the first time with the child, the parents must drop
a coin or any metal object into the lake. This gesture is considered an act of respect
for the lake’s ancestral spirits, who are believed to protect the child.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Maranao are basically Sunni Muslims, although traces of minor Shiite and
Sufi influences can also be found. Islamic religious roles include that of the imam or the
kali, which are affiliated with bangsa titles. The ceremonial calendar is Islamic (Lebar
1975:39). Tan (1985:3-9) argues that the survival and spread of Islam can be
attributed to its ability to accommodate indigenous beliefs and customs. The kind of
Islam that arrived in the Philippines had already assimilated various other traditions.
Politically, this folk Islam was further indigenized when the local baranganic structure
persisted in the sultanate system. Local terms for political leadership show little
Islamic influence. For example: solotan (judge), paninin diungan (past sultan), datu
(chief), rajah moda (sultan’s adjutant), sultan cabugatan (superior judge), sancupan
(attorney), cabugatan (justice of the peace), casanguan (counselor), and modim.
Islamic influence can be seen in the following terms: sarip (keeper of traditions), alim
(sublime porter), sherif, shayuk, hadji, imam, and calip or halip (Tan 1985:11).</p>
    <p class="content">Most Maranao follow standard Islamic beliefs and practices. The Quran is
considered by all Muslims as the Words of Allah (God), revealed to the Prophet
Muhammad through Archangel Gabriel, and as the source of all Islamic principles and
values. Aside from the Quran, other Islamic sources of law include the Sunnah or
Hadith (literally, “a way, rule, or manner of acting”) which recounts the deeds and
sayings of the Prophet Muhammad; and the Ijma and Iftinad, a revisable collection of
the opinions of Islamic jurists. The Five Pillars of Islam are faith in one God and the
four obligations of praying, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca at least once
in one’s lifetime.</p>
    <p class="content">The concept of jihad or natural right to self-defense finds expression in holy war,
when Muslim land and religion are threatened. Warriors of jihad are guaranteed a
place in sorga (heaven). The Muslims believe that the world divides into two spheres:
Darar-Islam (Islamic Sphere) and Dar-ar-Hard (non-Islamic Sphere). The first
subdivides into four territories: forbidden, i.e., Mecca and Medina; reserve, i.e., Iraq,
Syria, the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Egypt, Afghanistan, and other areas controlled by
Muslims; canonical, where Muslims are allowed to practice their faith in a non-Islamic
country, like the Philippines; and irredentist, of which Muslims had control until they
were forced out, e.g., Spain and Israel. Polygyny is allowed; a Muslim man can have
up to four wives if he can provide for them. However, this practice is slowly
becoming unpopular (Isidro 1976:46-52).</p>
    <p class="content">Islam, however, has not totally eradicated the pre-Islamic Maranao cosmology
that talks of a seven-layered earth, the first of which is the human world, and the 
second, populated by the karibang (dwarfs). Angels occupy the sky, which is
likewise seven-layered; heaven is found on the final layer. Hell is a deep, dirty, and
dark abode for sinners.</p>
    <p class="content">Folk medicine expresses the pre-Islamic belief that illnesses are caused by spirits
and can only be cured by the pamomolong (witch doctor), the pundarpaan who can
act as a medium to the spirits, or the pamamantok who fights black magic (A. Madale
1976:7-13; Lebar 1975:39). The Maranao still believe in pre-Islamic spirits and beings,
and the practices associated with them. These include the kadaolat sa miyatai
(literally, “invitation to the dead”), a rite performed seven days after the death of a
Maranao; the kapamangangai sa tonong (“inviting the spirits”), which attends various
occasions such as deciding to become a farmer, protecting one’s rice or corn fields,
revenge, and others; the katao (amulets); kaapar, which dictates the offering of newly
harvested rice to the spirits before it is eaten; saitan or spirits of the balete tree;
invisible beings such as apo (tornado spirits), sakit (illness-causing spirits), and
inikadowa (counterego).</p>
    <p class="content">It is believed that a lunar eclipse is caused by a giant lion that has swallowed the
moon. When this occurs, the Maranao play their gongs and recite: “Arimaonga boka
inga so olan ka mbangkitun a doniya” (Lion, please release the moon because the world
will come to an end).</p>
