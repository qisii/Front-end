    <p class="content">In the 19th century, the Bilaan inhabited the hilly region behind the west coast of Davao
Gulf. Their territory extended all the way into Bagobo country to the north and
westward into the Davao-Cotabato watershed. Culturally, the Bilaan are related to the
Bagobo and the Mandaya as evidenced by pronounced similarities in architecture,
clothing, ornamentation, and socioreligious practices. By 1910, the estimated Bilaan
population was about 10,000, of whom some 1,500 lived on Sarangani. Because of the
mountainous terrain and environment, there was practically no local group organization;
houses were separated by long stretches. Whenever there was a neighborhood, the
number of houses was small. Over the years, settlers from the Visayan islands came to
Mindanao and occupied the coastal plains and foothills on the western coast of the
Davao Gulf, which was traditionally part of Bilaan country. Gradually, the Bilaan were
pushed deeper back into the interior, without much resistance on their part. In the
distant past, the Bilaan were actively engaged in warfare. Along with the Manobo,
Mandaya, Bagobo, and Tagacaolo, they had at one time or another reduced their
neighbors in southwestem Mindanao to the status of tribute-paying “colonies” (Casal
1986:55).</p>

    <p class="content">Virtually all of the tribal groups living in the Philippines are farmers. The principal crops are wet rice and maize; while vegetables, tobacco, and coffee are grown as secondary crops. Some domestic animals such as dogs, goats, and chickens are also raised on the farms. </p>
    <p class="content">Swidden farming is the main agricultural method used by the Bilaan. In their rather
    small clearings, they grow rice, corn, millet, sweet potato, sugarcane, banana, papaya,
    pineapple, vegetables, tobacco, and abaca. The plots usually lie adjacent to their homes. The farmers also depend heavily on irrigated rice terraces which are located on the mountain slopes. Since such primitive "slash and burn" techniques are still used, the crop yield is generally poor. In addition, many of the native forests in the Philippines have been destroyed. </p>
    <p class="content">Some of the tribes (such as the Manobo who live on the southeastern coast of Mindanao) have been heavily influenced by plantation agriculture. Others living in the mountainous areas are still primarily hunters and gatherers. </p>
    <p class="content">Most of the tribal villages are arranged in clusters around individual gardens. The basic unit of society among these tribes is the extended family. Marriages are most often arranged while the prospective bride and groom are still quite young. Since the tribes have strict taboos on sexual relations between relatives, most marriages are "exogamous," or with members of another tribe. </p>
    <p class="content">Depending on the influence of outside cultures, the clothing of the tribes varies. Some wear simple loin cloths, while others dress in modern style clothing. </p>
    <p class="content">There seems to be very little political organization within the tribes. However, most villages do have a "headman" or chief who acts as a judge and defender.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Polititcal System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Bilaan communities are dispersed into small clusters of houses over great distances.
This has inhibited the evolution of a central authority system. The long stretch between
two river valley settlements never allowed easy communication. Instead of a central
authority, what developed was a settlement-based strong local leader. The position is
hereditary. A local leader can be succeeded by his son. But if the latter proved to be
incapable, someone else, a courageous man known as a lebe (“renowned warrior”) who
is analogous to the magani, bagani, or bahani in other lumad groups, can take his place.
In the past, in order to gain the highly prized status of lebe, raids were undertaken to
take captives for slavery or human sacrifice. The local leader acts as an arbiter in disputes.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Visual Arts and Crafts<img src="stage-props.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">Both men and women wear abaca cloth for the top and bottom pieces. The women’s
blouse is heavily decorated with embroidery, beads, and buttons. The women may also
wear necklaces, anklets, and numerous tiny bells hanging around their waistline. There
may also be some aromatic root or fragrant flower decorating their waist piece. The
men’s jackets are sometimes more ornately decorated than the women’s. They wear
their tight-fitting trousers kneelength. A long red sash is wound around their waist
several times and is worn especially during certain social gatherings.</p>
    <p class="content">Men and women shave their eyebrows, file or cut their incisors, and blacken these
together with their tongues. The men practice tattooing of arms, legs, chest, and back,
and some still wear their hair long.
</p>
    <p class="content">Like the Manobo and the Tboli, the Bilaan use soft thin strips of bamboo for weaving 
two-tone baskets (black and natural) in varying sizes: personal carrying baskets hung
from the shoulder or larger ones which serve as containers for their crops. Another
type of basket for which both Bilaan and Bagobo are known is the wild chicken trap,
“an implement that most men in these groups would possess” (Lane 1986:192). The
actual trap or snare consists of a series of small loops made of long, thin, flexible, and
braided rattan strips. They are set on the ground by means of three stakes that have
carved finial on top. A woven looped rattan chain secures the prey to the stake, once it
takes to the bait. This wild chicken trap usually goes with another kind of basket: a
small backpack that a hunter carries when he goes to the forest. A small bamboo
internode is sometimes fitted into it for carrying bait, such as seeds, ground corn, or
grain. Elaborately carved wooden supports, feathers, horsehair, and small bells
sometimes decorate this backpack.</p>

  <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
  <p class="content">Most of the tribal groups are animists, believing in many gods and spirits who control life situations and circumstances. They believe that these deities have human emotions and must be appeased by means of sacrifice and worship. These gods are believed to exist in both living and inanimate objects. </p>
  <p class="content">The villagers believe that there are specific rituals that must be observed in order to ensure a successful journey into the next life. Some of the groups (such as the Itneg tribes) utilize female shamans, or mediums, in their elaborate rituals. They believe the shamans have power to cure the sick by magic, to communicate with the gods, and to control events. </p>
  <p class="content">There are other tribes (such as the Kalinga) who believe that the spirits, or anitos, may be their deceased relatives of whom the souls have not been properly sent to the after world. </p>
  <p class="content">In the Kankannaey tribes, the priesthood is led by men rather than women. The primary sacrifices used in their rituals are pigs. </p>
  <p class="content">Although the Manobo tribes believe in a supreme being that inhabits the "sky world," and the Binukid have had some exposure to Christianity, these tribes, like the others, remain unreached with the Gospel. They are a people living in deep bondage to senseless rituals and spirit worship.</p>

  <p class="content">Although these remote tribes are slowly being forced into a modern world, they continue to struggle daily with life's most basic essentials. They are in desperate need of quality medical care, modern farming techniques, and educational opportunities. </p>
  <p class="content">Specific strategies must be developed in order to see these tribes reached with the Gospel.</p>

  <li class="content">Ask God to strengthen, encourage, and protect the small number of Christians living among them.</li>
  <li class="content">Ask the Holy Spirit to soften the hearts of the tribesmen towards Christians so that they will be receptive to the Gospel. </li>
  <li class="content">Pray that God will cause the governmental leaders of the Philippines to turn to God for guidance and help. </li>
  <li class="content">Ask the Lord to raise up strong local churches among each tribal group in the Philippines.</li>
