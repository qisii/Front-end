    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The proto-Manobo people originally established their settlements on riverbanks and
along the coasts of northern Mindanao in an era before the birth of Christ. The
population grew steadily until the coming of the Sri Vijayans, followed by the conquest
of Madjapahit invaders. Those who were driven into the interior came to be called
“Bukidnon” by the Visayan immigrants and “Monteses” by the Spaniards.</p>
    <p class="content">It was only around the mid-19th century that Spanish influence was felt in Bukidnon,
for the jurisdiction of Misamis province extended to the northern part of the unexplored
area. Then, by 1869, a politico-military government was established for Mindanao, and
the Misamis-Bukidnon region became one of its six districts. Bukidnon was a part of
Misamis until the end of the Spanish regime. During the American period, it became a
subprovince of Misamis and later of Agusan in 1907. In 1914 Bukidnon became a
separate province.</p>
    <p class="content">In 1910 the anthropologist Fay-Cooper Cole observed that the Bukidnon people were
of three physical types: the Negritoid, Visayan, and Caucasoid. The Negritoid was the
result of intermarriages with the aboriginal Aeta population; the Visayan descended
from the Sri Vijayan and Madjapahit invaders; and the Caucasoid emerged during the
colonial periods. Culturally, the Bukidnon may also be classified according to the three
following types: the nontraditional, semitraditional, and traditional. The first group has
been assimilated into the national culture, the second mixes both indigenous and
cosmopolitan practices and beliefs, and the third has kept the indigenous culture intact
because of its isolated habitat. This unevenness in degree of cultural assimilation among
various Bukidnon groups has been observed by one anthropologist who, in 1955, noted
that the lowland Bukidnon had adapted to Visayan ways, while a northern group was
still wearing Talaandig costume and practicing tattooing and teeth mutilation.
Anthropologist Carmen Ching-Unabia observed in 1986 that, generally, the only
distinguishing marks of the Bukidnon were the tangkulo (male headgear) and their
practice of betel nut chewing. However, there are Bukidnon in the mountain forests
whose traditions are still intact.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Economy<img src="agronomy.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Bukidnon’s major means of subsistence are food gathering and swidden agriculture.
The men fish and hunt; the women gather shellfish and jungle roots. Some women still
make pottery and weave hemp and cotton cloth, although these industries have greatly
declined because of the entry of trade goods. However, a source of pride for the
Bukidnon women is their skill in making applique and embroidered garments. Mat
weaving and basketry are done by both sexes. Blacksmiths make knives and
spearheads; brass casting is done by the process of wax molding.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Political System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The datu has two main functions: to judge and arbitrate in matters of dispute and assist
the babaylan (shaman) in religious ceremonies. He is chosen by virtue of the qualities
that he shows in his youth: a sense of fairness, intelligence, curiosity, and willingness to
learn Bukidnon culture and lore. The datu is protected by a group of spirits: Omalagad,
Pamahandi, Tumanod, Molin-olin, and Ibabasuk. His guiding spirit is Dumalungdung.
</p>
    <p class="content">A man chosen to be a datu undergoes several ceremonies in his lifetime as he
progressively rises a step higher in rank. When he is about 15 to 17 years old, the
village may notice that he has the qualities of a good datu. He undergoes the panlisig
ceremony to keep evil spirits away from him. He then undergoes pani-ib, an
apprenticeship period where he learns the Bukidnon riddles, proverbs, belief system,
pantheon of gods, myths, case reference stories, epic of Agyu, customs, and laws. A
few years later, he undergoes the panumanuron, a simple initiation ceremony in which
the good spirit Tumanod is invited to descend on him so he will become wise in decision
making. Three chickens or roosters—red, white, and black—are ritually sacrificed. The
white fowl represents Tumanod and the virtues of purity of heart, wisdom, and
sincerity; the red fowl, Talabusaw and the vices of anger and hatred; the black fowl, the
evil spirits. He is made to handle simple cases to test his soundness of judgment and 
knowledge of custom law. Between 30 and 35 years old, he undergoes the ceremony for
the first degree of datuship, the tagulambong hu datu, the root word lambong literally
meaning “widespread branches,” symbolizing the datu’s ability to protect and feed his
people. Hence, his land and granary must be available to all. He is sometimes expected
to provide the bridewealth for a groom who cannot afford it. At the age of 45 to 50
years old, the gulugundo ceremony, a lavish ritual-feast, acknowledges his lordly status.
The last ceremony is the linangkaban, performed when the datu is about 75 years old,
venerated as one who has reached the apex of wisdom. He is carried on a hammock
when he travels from village to village to judge and arbitrate.

    <p class="content">Traditional fabric for women’s clothing was abaca or hemp, but is now cotton cloth
obtained through trade. Red, blue, and white strips, or rectangular or square pieces of
cloth are sewn together to make a wide saya (skirt). The hem may be adorned with
patchwork or embroidered triangles, zigzag lines, or realistic figures, such as the human
form, fruits, and flowers. The skirt is held up by a bagkus, a similarly decorated sash,
or a golongan, a waistband around which are sewn numerous saliyaw (small brass bells).
The ginilangan (blouse) is even more fully decorated, covered with patchwork or
embroidered designs boldly outlined in yarn. The patterns on the skirt are repeated on
the blouse. The blouse is sinulaman if it is embroidered; ginuntingan if made up of red,
black, and white stripes sewn together; and tinudtudan if adorned with patchwork of
geometric shapes. The typical colors are black, white, red, and a tinge of yellow.</p>
    <p class="content">The taming is a round shield woven out of bamboo sticks and rattan strips. The sticks,
radiating from a small wooden disk. compose the base under and over which the rattan
strips pass. The outer edge is finally held together by woven rattan added to it. Baskets are made of bamboo, rattan, and pandanus. They are simply decorated with
alternating outer enameled strips and dull inner ones.
</p>
    <p class="content">Mats and rice winnowers are made of wild grass or rattan. A mat may be used as a bed,
seat, table, musical instrument, and wrapping for the dead. Crude mats of pandanus are
used for drying grains, such as coffee. Various colored straws are woven to make
simple designs.
</p>
    <p class="content">Decoration on pottery consists of incised scroll designs placed just below the rim.
Wood carving ranges from very crude representations of human beings in ceremonies to
decorative sections of musical instruments. The wooden doll lantangon in the kaliga-on
ceremony has vague lines merely suggesting the eyes, nose, and mouth. It is dressed in
white, wears a red headband, and is placed on a miniature bamboo seat. It is used once
then discarded</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Bukidnon believe in charms. The tigbas is a magic stone which fell from the sky.
It is owned only by the datu. A rare kind of stone, owned by a very few Bukidnon, is
the tigbas a kilat, “teeth of the lightning,” because it fell on the spot struck by
lightning. It has the power to stop violent storms.
</p>
    <p class="content">The magbabaya and the kaliga-on are referred to as diwata, but not the lesser alabyanon
nor the gimukod of the dead. The term for any of the spirits is magtitima/tomitima.</p>
    <p class="content">The earth is supported by one male and one female serpent, called intombangol, who lie
across each other to form a cross. Their mouths are submerged in the water where earth
and sky meet. Their movement causes earthquakes; their breath causes the winds; and
their panting creates violent storms.
</p>
    <p class="content">The baylan performs pamuhat or religious ceremonies, which are held in the various
stages of agriculture and of the life cycle, such as house building or preparing a clearing.
The baylan’s services are also required to cure an epidemic or diagnose an illness. A
person is not called by the spirits to become a baylan. When a person decides to
become one, he/she is apprenticed to an experienced baylan. According to folk
tradition, the first baylan was taught by Molinolin, patron and guide of the baylan. His
assistants are the gods Ongli and Dumalungdung, who help diagnose illness.
</p>
    <p class="content">The most important and lavish pamuhat is the kaliga-on, which used to last nine days
but is now reduced to three. It is the fulfillment of a panaad, a vow made to a god to
offer prayers and material things like betel nut, cloth, and animals. The kaliga-on is
performed for a bountiful harvest, hunting and fishing, the healing of the sick, before
housebuilding, for a successful business venture, and so on. Other kaliga-on ceremonies
are the kasaboahan, which is in honor of the god Malibotan and his grandfather, and
the magbabaya minumsob, which is held by a bridal pair to ensure a happy union.</p>
