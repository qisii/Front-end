    <h3 class="title2">History<img src="scroll.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The Manobo are several people groups who inhabit the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. They speak one of the languages belonging to the Manobo language family. Their origins can be traced back to the early Malay peoples who came from the surrounding islands of Southeast Asia. Today, their common cultural language and Malay heritage help to keep them connected.</p>
    <p class="content">The Manobo cluster includes eight groups: the Cotabato Manobo, Agusan Manobo, Dibabawon Manobo, Matig Salug Manobo, Sarangani Manobo, Manobo of Western Bukidnon, Obo Manobo, and Tagabawa Manobo. The groups are often connected by name with either political divisions or landforms. The Bukidnons, for example, are located in a province of the same name. The Agusans, who live near the Agusan River Valley, are named according to their location.</p>
    <p class="content">The eight Manobo groups are all very similar, differing only in dialect and in some aspects of culture. The distinctions have resulted from their geographical separation.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Economy<img src="agronomy.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The upland Manobo practice swidden or slash-and-burn farming, whereas those
inhabiting the valleys practice wet-rice farming. Rice culture is so central to the
Manobo way of life that there are more than 60 different names for rice varieties and
all agricultural rituals center around it. In the late 1950s, however, many Manobo
groups shifted to corn culture because of the gradual disappearance of swidden sites.
Besides corn grit, other supplementary foods are sweet potato and cassava. In times
of famine, emergency foods are unripe bananas and wild yam. Other major means of
subsistence are fishing, hunting, bee hunting, and trapping. Because of these
occupations, the Manobo live a seminomadic life. However, some Manobo villages
that have established permanent settlements have shifted to the cultivation of coconut
for copra export.
</p>
    <p class="content">A typical village engaged in swidden farming begins the agricultural cycle in February,
when rice and corn are planted. The corn is harvested in July but rice takes longer to
grow and is harvested in November. During the summer, while the people are waiting
to harvest these two crops, sweet potatoes and cassava are the staple food. Abaca is
raised and sold to Chinese traders or their agents, who take them to the urban centers.
</p>
    <p class="content">An occupation that figures as entertainment for the Manobo is bee hunting, the
procedure for which is the basis of the comic bee-hunting dance. Bees appear during
the season when the trees start to bloom. The hunter waits for them along creek banks
and trails them to their hive. If he catches a bee, he ties a fluff of cotton to it and then 
releases it. When the bee reaches its hive, the other bees raise such a buzzing noise,
that the hunter is led to the location of the hive. He builds a fire to smoke out the bees
and then climbs the tree to get the empty hive. However, the hunter faces hazards,
such as the tree catching fire or the bees attacking him.
</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="title2">Political System<img src="indian.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The political structures of the Manobo groups are all quite similar. A ruler, called a sultan, is the head of the group. Beneath him are the royal and non-royal classes. Only those people belonging to the royal classes can aspire to the throne. Those belonging to the non-royal classes are under the power and authority of the royal classes. Each class is interdependent on the others.
</p>
    <p class="content">The political aspects of life are often integrated with the social aspects. For example, many social events, such as weddings, require political leaders. Whenever there is a negotiation for marriage, both the bride and the groom must use the local datu (headman) to make all of the arrangements.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Visual Arts and Crafts<img src="stage-props.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The women weave splendid decorations into their garments. The Spaniards once
marveled at them and called them the “most handsomely dressed natives.” The
contemporary ordinary attire of the women consists of the tube skirt and a simple
blouse. The skirt may have a floral pattern in earthen tones like russet, orange, or burnt
sienna; or it may be in paisley and checkered prints. The blouse has short bell sleeves
and simple lace edging around the neck, arms, and waist. The blouse is short enough to
show the abdomen. Among the older women, this area of flesh is tattooed. For
adornment, simple earplugs and a shell bracelet are worn. The men wear cotton
drawstring trousers topped by an ordinary shirt. The older men wear a plain tangkulu or
headkerchief.</p>
    <p class="content">Traditional clothes and jewelry are now worn only for village feasts and religious 
ceremonies. The ceremonial attire of the Bagobo is most ornate and artistic. The
Bagobo tie-dye abaca fibers in deep red, maroon, and black. The sheen of the undyed
white fibers provides a sharp contrast. They weave these fibers into longitudinal strips
with geometric designs representing nature and human beings. The motifs, spaces, and
symmetrics are recalled from memory. They polish the fabric, called tnalak, with
stones and shells to bring out a special luster and softness.</p>
    <p class="content">The men wear tnalak shorts, which are bordered by two wide horizontal bands, beaded
with intricate designs. To keep the overlapped material secure at the waist, they use a
wide, buckled belt of unique make, with close strands of interlinked brass or copper
chains, at the end of which are handcrafted and multitoned brass bells. A second belt
holds the bolo and knives, which the men always carry. These heirloom tools and
weapons were decorated by a wax process that is now forgotten. Bagobo men wear a
close-fitting undershirt, over which is their tinalak coat, finely beaded with complex
designs around the neckline, sleeves, borders, front, and back. Its front flaps are left
open. Personal belongings, such as the betel box of brass with copper and gold inlays,
are secured in a tinalak shoulder bag also decorated with fine beads, tassels, and bells.
They wear immense mother-of-pearl or ivory earrings (see logo of this article), which
are unique to them, multistrand colored necklaces, and layers of bells below their knees.
Their long hair is wrapped in a specially-dyed kerchief, the edges of which are bordered
with fine, multicolored tassels and beads. The bagani is the only person privileged to
wear the colored, closed shirt, and the tangkulu or the claret-colored turban. Completing
the attire of the Bagobo warrior is the armor called gindua, which is worn over an inner
armor made of abaca strips.</p>

    <h3 class="title2">Beliefs<img src="belief.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The religious beliefs of the Manobo revolve around many unseen spirits interfering in the lives of humans. They believe these spirits can intrude on human activities to accomplish their desires. The spirits are also believed to have human characteristics. They are both good and evil in nature and can be evoked to both anger and pleasure.</p>
    <p class="content">While the religious practices of the Manobo vary slightly, there seems to be at least one common thread linking them together. Each culture believes in one "great spirit." This "great spirit" is usually viewed as the creator figure.</p>
    <p class="content">As the various Manobo groups have been separated, the religious beliefs of other peoples have influenced them somewhat. However, the Manobo have often incorporated these new practices into their belief system, rather than abandoning their practices and being converted to new religions.</p>
    <p class="content" style="font-weight: bold;">Prayer Points:</p>
    <li class="content">Scripture Prayers for the Manobo, Tagabawa Bagobo in Philippines.</li>
    <li class="content">Pray for a resolution to an ongoing land dispute.</li>
    <li class="content">Ask the Lord to call people who are willing to go to the Philippines and share Christ with the Manobo.</li>
    <li class="content">Pray that God will raise up Christian workers to live among them and teach them agricultural skills.</li>
    <li class="content">Ask God to encourage and protect the small number of Manobo Christians, and equip them to minister the Gospel to their own people.</li>
    <li class="content">Ask the Holy Spirit to soften their hearts towards Christians so that they will be receptive to the Gospel.</li>
    <li class="content">Pray that God will give missions agencies strategies for effectively reaching them</li>
    <li class="content">Ask the Lord to raise up strong local churches among each of the Manobo groups.</li>

  <div class="end">
    <h3 class="title2">Needs<img src="basic-needs.png" class="icon1_about"></h3>
    <p class="content">The farming techniques used by many of the Manobo groups are primitive. Inefficiency of labor hinders economic growth in their communities. Agricultural development projects are greatly needed to educate them on such things as crop rotation and use of chemical fertilizers. Such training would not only enhance their efforts, but also provide open doors through which missionaries may enter.</p>
    <p class="content">Another need of the Manobo lies within the area of their culture. These groups speak many different languages and dialects. This has made learning to speak and write their languages very difficult for outsiders. The smaller cultures are being pressed upon by larger groups that surround them. Because of this, they fear losing their original languages and cultural idiosyncrasies. An effort must be made to preserve their original culture so that these fears will be calmed.</p>
    <p class="content">Spiritually, the Manobo need a Savior! They must be told that there is a loving God who longs to make them a part of His family. Who will tell them that the "great creator spirit" is really a Father who cares for them? Prayer alone has the power to break through the strongholds of spirit worship. Intercessors are needed to daily stand in the gap and pray for the salvation of these precious people.</p>
